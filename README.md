# Calculator

link to project -->  https://mhickner44.github.io/Calculator/
This is a small calculator that I completed going through the Odin Project. 
It has limited abilities because I followed the constraints of the project I was doing. The constraints on the calculator are that it only processes a single pair of numbers at a time instead of entire expressions. 
EX.12 + 7 - 5 * 3 =42 instead of =4

What I learned 
    -Dealing with floating point numbers 
    -regex
